## Description
In this competition, you’ll develop a model to match individual whales and dolphins by unique—but often subtle—characteristics of their natural markings. You'll pay particular attention to dorsal fins and lateral body views in image sets from a multi-species dataset built by 28 research institutions. The best submissions will suggest photo-ID solutions that are fast and accurate.
